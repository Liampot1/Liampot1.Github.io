    <td>The strategy that I thought were effective were observing but taking part and making objections so that I can find out how certain codes work like when they use a $ sign after code to show that it is a variable. Which is very helpful to know when or if I will make code on my own in the future. Also again this lesson me and my partner spencer like most other lessons were constantly saving our work as knowing my luck and skill we might need it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>

I think that because both of us had problems with our website that stopped us from doing work and we had to do that but besides from that I do not think anything stopped us from our work and doing as well as we could for it.

Next time I hope to get near the end or even potentially finish exercise 1-3 as then I will be able to say to myself that I know how to do the basics of Raspberry PI coding.</td>
