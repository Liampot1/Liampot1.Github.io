    <td>I think what let me down this lesson was that in many subjects I was clueless to what was supposed to be happening and although Mr Keen did say that it was something that would usually be done in GCSE it was still a bit annoying that for most of it I was clueless but luckily now I know what is happening in lots of important code chunks.</td>
