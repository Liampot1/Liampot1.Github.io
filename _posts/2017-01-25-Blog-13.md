    <td>Teamwork was the thing that helped me most as the 10% of Python I did was particularly hard ranging in things I had never seen and a part which took a group of 3 people 20 minutes to do which is surprising given the simplicity of the actual answer. </td>

    <td>I think the exercise as previously mentioned was the thing that held me back the most as we used up a lot of time on something we didn't need to spend a long time on.</td>
