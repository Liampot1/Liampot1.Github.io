    <td>I think that after we got started and learned the ropes of the code it was much easier to complete and restart tasks as well as saving them or exiting codes without the screen freezing or crashing. I think that even it is only 3-4 lines of new code you should save it incase you delete your files or the computer programs crash.</td>

    <td>I will not change anything to my performance and work on week #2 besides from my attention and my ability not to get distracted to easily. Also I say this as I think I might be able to do 1 Â½ excercises maximum which I think is very good. </td>
