Hacking A Bank in IT

Today we were working on google sheets for the 3rd lesson in a row and it was very fun. These last few lessons we were working on code breaking which has been very fun and helpful. And as a side tangent this is the reason I love IT because unlike lots of subjects IT teaches you lots of skills that you can use in the real world. Now back to the subject at hand. Mr Tansley in this lesson was teaching us how to type in whole strings of words and then the code separates them so that they can be coded into a new message. This was hard but with the help of my partner and Mr Tansley I was able to finish it quickly and precisely. To conclude in the last few lessons with have been learning how to change messages into code and then put that code into a string and then solve it this whole experience has been very enjoyable.
