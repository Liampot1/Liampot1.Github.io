  <tr>
    <td>I took a while to setup up my computer as some people disconnected some cords and wires. Also at the start of the lesson the computer was blank screening us so that also delayed our work severely. Overall I need to work on being able to setup the raspberry pi's quickly and efficiently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In my next lesson I will not be changing anything except hopefully improving the speed in which I setup my workstation and also improving on the work and code we do in the lesson.

Also I want to get onto Exercise 1.2 as i think that would be quite cool.</td>
