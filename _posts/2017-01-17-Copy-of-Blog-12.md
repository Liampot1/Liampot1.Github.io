(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I did as you can see at My Blog I have implemented these things and although it is basic it does seem to work.</td>

    <td>I think that while I was researching and asking my friends I made a lot more progress than usual in fact trusting a friend named will actually made we able to do the task as he didn't do it for me but showed me how to do it with skill and so it will look good so I think research and trusts are the main reasons that I succeeded so highly in the lesson today.</td>

    <td>I think that nothing limited my learning in school but at home for homework I lost my charger for my laptop and so could not do as much as fast for Github.</td>

    <td>Next time I will hopefully have found my charger (although I haven't yet) and be able to work to my total capability without the disability of having to use my iPad which while work doesn't help me multitask.</td>
