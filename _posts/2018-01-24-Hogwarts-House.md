This week we were preparing for our final test on creating a Buzzfeed like Quiz, I am doing one of the which Harry Potter houses are you as they are quite easily distinguishable and I have a lot of examples that I can base my research and questions on. But in the lesson our teacher showed us the many ways in which we can measure the answer that we come to at the end of the test now personally I am going for the adding up method as it does crate good results and while failure is possible it is much more unlikely. As well as this in the lesson we practiced on an actual BUZZFEED quiz which actually showed me that you shouldn't are obvious questions which clearly relate to each house as people will realise this and pick the one to get the results that they personally want which can then cause dispute when later thy get different results. 

After the lesson at home I worked on writing 4 more questions so that I have 6 questions ready for the lesson on Wednesday. I really enjoyed today's lesson as it provided a way that we can experience what is going on and not just mindlessly copy down code, I also like this as it gives us leaneance to do what we want and what we have to do and subsequently I believe I will have a better code than what I would've had if I was more restricted.
