    <td>In this lesson all that I had to do was copy down the basic code and put some more tweaks in so that is was ready to go and I would say that I have done that as I have a working copy of the code and all the text is laid out ready for the hard work that is to come. Overall the way I learned was just focusing and doing the hard and menial work before the hard and complex work. Also I would say that due to the outcome of the work my strategy worked well and I am looking forward to see how I'll do in the next lesson when all of the very hard work will start coming in. :) :)  (: (:</td>

    <td>I think that what limited my learning was the lack of more mentally challenging code and subsequently I wasnâ€™t challenged enough.</td>
