  <tr>
    <td>I think my most effective strategy for working and discovering new things was experimenting with the program and trying again and again until I get it correct. Which in my opinion worked very very well until we got deeper into the Exercise 1.1 and code I had to be more careful or it would take to long to complete and reset which made me focus more and more.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that when setting up the computer I got to confused and in struggle (luckily later two classmates helped me set this up) as well as this I think if I had spent more time reading the manual then experimenting i could've got much more done.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time the only major thing that i will change is my comparison of reading the manual compared to learning and experimenting on the source code creator.

Overall despite the slight lack of improvement I did it was very fun and I did learn how to properly setup the computer and because of the time that I spent setting up the computer to actual code work will greatly improve in the next lesson.</td>
